# Creating a API Key
To get started with Discord Place API, you need to create an API key. This key is used to authenticate your requests to the API and access the data you need to manage your bot effectively.

1. **Log in to Discord Place:** Head over to the [Discord Place website](https://discord.place/) and sign in using your Discord credentials.

2. **Find Your Bot:** Once logged in, locate your bot within the bot list and click on it to access its details.

3. **Access Bot Manage Page:** Within the bot details page, hit the "Manage Bot" button to proceed to the bot manage page.

4. **Generate Your API Key:** In the bot managed page, you'll discover an option to create a new API key. Simply click on the "Generate New API Key" button to initiate the process.

### Congratulations! :tada:
