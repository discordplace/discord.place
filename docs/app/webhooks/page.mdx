# Webhooks

## Vote Webhooks

To get started, go to your management page (server or bot) and then fill in the Webhook options.

We will send a `POST` request to your webhook URL. The request will contain the following information:

#### Body

```json
{
  "bot": "string",
  "user": "string",
  "test": "boolean"
}
```

```json
{
  "guild": "string",
  "user": "string",
  "test": "boolean"
}
```
##### Notes
The `bot` and `guild` fields are optional. If the webhook is for a bot, the `bot` field will be present. If the webhook is for a server, the `guild` field will be present.

The `test` field is used to indicate if the webhook is a test webhook. If it is a test webhook, the `test` field will be `true`, otherwise it will be `false`.

#### Headers

- `Content-Type`: `application/json`
- `Authorization`: `YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`

*PS: If response status code is not `>=200 && <300`, we will retry the request 3 times with a delay of 5 seconds. If the request still fails, we will stop retrying.*
