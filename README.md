> [!NOTE]
> - The `GITHUB_AUTO_DEPLOY_SECRET` is used for auto-deploying the server when a new release created in the GitHub repository. When this secret is set and you have set up the GitHub webhook, the server will automatically deploy the new release when a new release is created in the repository.
> - The `GITHUB_AUTO_SYNC_TRANSLATORS_SECRET` is used for syncing the translators roles when a push is made to the `main` branch. When this secret is set and you have set up the GitHub webhook, the server will automatically sync the translators roles in the base guild with the ids in the `client/locales/translators.json` file.
> - You should use 256-bit secret keys for the `BOT_API_KEY_ENCRYPT_SECRET`, `USER_TOKEN_ENCRYPT_SECRET` and `PAYMENTS_CUSTOM_DATA_ENCRYPT_SECRET_KEY` values. You can use [this tool](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/plain) to generate a 256-bit key in hexadecimal format quickly.
> - For the `MONGO_URL` value, you can use a local MongoDB instance or a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas. Refer to the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string) for more information on constructing the connection URL.
> - Values starting with `S3_` are required. This is used for storing emojis & sounds files in S3 (and also database backups). We personally use Cloudflare R2 Storage for this. You can use any S3-compatible storage service with the same configuration.
> - The `CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is used for verifying the Turnstile token. We use Cloudflare Turnstile for ensuring that the user is a human and not a bot on the website. Refer to the [Cloudflare Turnstile documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/#get-a-sitekey-and-secret-key) to get your Turnstile secret key.
> - The `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`, and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` values are required for interacting with the Cloudflare API. You can get the API key from the Cloudflare dashboard.
> - The `CLOUDFLARE_BLOCK_IP_LIST_ID` is used for blocking IP addresses within the Cloudflare firewall. Refer to the [Cloudflare WAF documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/create-dashboard/) to create a list. After creating the list, you can get the list ID from the URL. (usually should be in the end of the URL)
> - The `DISCORD_PLACE_API_KEY` is used for authenticating requests to the discord.place API endpoints. This is not required for self-hosting. We use this for update our bot's command count every day on the website.
> - The `DISCORD_PLACE_INSTATUS_API_KEY` is used for authenticating requests to the discord.place Instatus API endpoints. This is not required for self-hosting. We use this for displaying the current status of the discord.place on the homepage. You can get this from the Instatus dashboard. Refer to the [Instatus API documentation](https://instatus.com/help/api) for more information.
> - The `LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN` is used for sending logs to Logtail. This is not required for self-hosting. We actually not use this in our production environment. But we wanted to keep this in the repository for future use.
> - The `LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is used for verifying the Lemon Squeezy webhook. This is not required for self-hosting. We use Lemon Squeezy for our payment system. Refer to the [Lemon Squeezy documentation](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/webhooks) for more information.
> - The `LEMON_SQUEEZY_API_KEY` is used for authenticating requests to the Lemon Squeezy API. This is not required for self-hosting. We use Lemon Squeezy for our payment system. Refer to the [Lemon Squeezy Developer Guide](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/guides/developer-guide/getting-started#create-an-api-key) to get your API key.
> - The `DISCORD_BOT_GET_APPROXIMATE_GUILD_COUNT_API_URL` and `DISCORD_BOT_GET_APPROXIMATE_GUILD_COUNT_API_SECRET` values are used for getting the approximate guild count of a bot. This is half required for self-hosting. If you don't want to use this feature, you can leave these values empty, but this will result in bots not being able to update server_count using the API. For now, we use private API for this because Discord doesn't provide an official API for getting the approximate guild count of a bot. We don't want to share this API source code with everyone.

### New Languages

To add a new language to the website, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `client/locales` directory with the format `xx.json`, where `xx` is the language code. For example, `fr.json` for French. You can use the existing language files as a reference.
2. Add the language code to the `availableLocales` value in the `client/config.js` file.
3. Add the translations for the new language to the JSON file you created. The JSON file should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "key": "value",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```
