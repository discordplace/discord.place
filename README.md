> [!NOTE]
> - The `GITHUB_AUTO_SYNC_TRANSLATORS_SECRET` is used for syncing the translators roles when a push is made to the `main` branch. When this secret is set and you have set up the GitHub webhook, the server will automatically sync the translators roles in the base guild with the ids in the `client/locales/translators.json` file.
> - You should use 256-bit secret keys for the `BOT_API_KEY_ENCRYPT_SECRET`, `USER_TOKEN_ENCRYPT_SECRET` and `PAYMENTS_CUSTOM_DATA_ENCRYPT_SECRET_KEY` values. You can use [this tool](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/plain) to generate a 256-bit key in hexadecimal format quickly.
> - The `CLIENT_SECRET` value is attached to the requests sent by the client's server-side rendering. You can use any random string for this value. This value is used for verifying the requests sent by the client's server-side rendering and should match the client's `CLIENT_SECRET` value.
> - The `DISCORD_PORTAL_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK_URL` is used for sending messages to the portal channel. This is not required for self-hosting. We use this webhook for sending messages to the portal channel for certain events like new bot approved, new emoji published, etc. __This webhook should be created by bot.__ Otherwise, no components (link buttons) will be sent with the messages. You can leave this value empty. Make sure to use a valid Discord webhook URL format (e.g., `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXX/XXX`).
> - For the `MONGO_URL` value, you can use a local MongoDB instance or a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas. Refer to the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string) for more information on constructing the connection URL.
> - Values starting with `S3_` are required. This is used for storing emojis & sounds files in S3 (and also database backups). We personally use Cloudflare R2 Storage for this. You can use any S3-compatible storage service with the same configuration. Note: You can leave the `S3_DATABASE_BACKUP_*` values empty if you don't want to use S3 for database backups. We use S3 for storing the database backups, but this is not required for self-hosting. If you leave these values empty, the server will not take any database backups and throws warnings in the console when you start the server.
> - The `CDN_URL` is used for serving emojis and sounds files. You should set this to your own CDN URL. Make sure to use valid URL format (e.g., `https://cdn.yourdomain.com`).
> - The `CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is used for verifying the Turnstile token. We use Cloudflare Turnstile for ensuring that the user is a human and not a bot on the website. Refer to the [Cloudflare Turnstile documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/#get-a-sitekey-and-secret-key) to get your Turnstile secret key.
> - The `LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is used for verifying the Lemon Squeezy webhook. This is not required for self-hosting. We use Lemon Squeezy for our payment system. Refer to the [Lemon Squeezy documentation](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/webhooks) for more information.
> - The `LEMON_SQUEEZY_API_KEY` is used for authenticating requests to the Lemon Squeezy API. This is not required for self-hosting. We use Lemon Squeezy for our payment system. Refer to the [Lemon Squeezy Developer Guide](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/guides/developer-guide/getting-started#create-an-api-key) to get your API key.
> - Values starting with `HEARTBEAT_ID_` are used for the heartbeat IDs for the heartbeats. We use [Better Stack Uptime](https://betterstack.com/uptime) for monitoring the uptime of the website.
> - The `DISCORD_BOT_GET_APPROXIMATE_GUILD_COUNT_API_URL` and `DISCORD_BOT_GET_APPROXIMATE_GUILD_COUNT_API_SECRET` values are used for getting the approximate guild count of a bot. This is half required for self-hosting. If you don't want to use this feature, you can leave these values empty, but this will result in bots not being able to update server_count using the API. For now, we use private API for this because Discord doesn't provide an official API for getting the approximate guild count of a bot. We don't want to share this API source code with everyone.
> - The `WEBHOOKS_PROXY_SERVER_PROTOCOL`, `WEBHOOKS_PROXY_SERVER_HOST`, `WEBHOOKS_PROXY_SERVER_PORT`, `WEBHOOKS_PROXY_SERVER_USERNAME`, and `WEBHOOKS_PROXY_SERVER_PASSWORD` values are used for the proxy server settings. We use a proxy server for sending webhooks requests. If you don't want to use a proxy server, you can leave these values empty. Username and password are not required for the proxy server.
> - The `SENTRY_DSN` value is used for Sentry error tracking. This is not required for self-hosting. We use Sentry for error tracking. Refer to the [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io) for more information.

### New Languages

#### Client
To add a new language to the website, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `client/locales` directory with the format `xx.json`, where `xx` is the language code. For example, `fr.json` for French. You can use the existing language files as a reference.
2. Add the language code to the `availableLocales` value in the `client/config.js` file.
3. Import the new language file in the `client/stores/language/index.js` file.
4. Add the new language to the `localeContents` object in the `client/stores/language/index.js` file.
3. Add the translations for the new language to the JSON file you created. The JSON file should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "key": "value",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```

#### Server
To add a new language to the server, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `server/src/locales` directory with the format `xx.json`, where `xx` is the language code. For example, `fr.json` for French. You can use the existing language files as a reference.
2. Add the language code to the `availableLocales` value in the `server/config.yml` file.
3. Add the translations for the new language to the JSON file you created. The JSON file should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "key": "value",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```
